# ExpenseShare

Frontend repository for my ExpenseShare application made in Angular with connection to my own ASP.NET Core Web API.

Idea for this app came with my frustration over lack of features in other expense helper solutions.
Why would not make my own app with everything I always wanted to have in terms of settling up expenses with my roommates?

*Hope this will be useful for other people*
